Introduction:
This mods brings introduces a "Double Chest" similar to the ones found in Minecraft. It also includes "Locked Double Chest". Below are installation instructions as well as the crafting recipies and other information.

How to install:
Unzip the archive and place it in minetest-base-directory/mods/
if you have a windows client or a linux run-in-place client. If you have
a linux system-wide instalation place it in ~/.minetest/mods/.
If you want to install this mod only in one world create the folder
worldmods/ in your worlddirectory.
In addition, you may clone from my github (windows users are on your own on this, as I know virtually nothing about git in windows).
For Linux installations, open a terminal and "cd" into your mods folder (optionally, navigate to the mods folder in your favorite file manager, then right click and click "open terminal here" for those more GUI inclined; then run
"git clone https://github.com/xfceKris/Double_Chest.git"

How to use the mod:
Craft a Double Chest like this:
[empty]   [empty]   [empty]
[Chest]   [Chest]   [Chest]
[empty]   [empty]   [empty]

Craft a Locked Double Chest like this:
[empty]   [steel ingot]   [empty]
[Chest]      [Chest]      [Chest]
[empty]   [steel ingot]   [empty]

After placing a Double Chest, it will expand to occupy two blocks. Once placed, the chest will function as a normal chest does.
